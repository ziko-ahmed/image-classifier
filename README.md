Image Classification Model

This project involves building a Machine Learning model capable of classifying images into different categories. The model has been trained on a dataset containing labeled images, providing high accuracy in identifying the respective classes.

Overview

The Image Classification Model is designed to automatically classify images into predefined categories. The model uses advanced deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze and classify images based on their visual content.

Dataset

The model has been trained on a dataset consisting of a variety of images. Each image is labeled with the correct class, allowing the model to learn distinctive features for accurate classification.

Features

High Accuracy: The model achieves high classification accuracy based on its training.
Customizable: You can fine-tune the model with your own dataset to classify different categories.
Efficient: The model is optimized for quick and reliable predictions.
